LIGHT IT UP CONTROLLER


1 - BLE
1.1 - Advertising
1.1.1 - Advertising packet structure

The device advertises a well defines packet as defined here below:

FIRST_LENGTH_POS: first length
ADV_TYPE_FLAGS_POS: adv flags type
BR_EDR_NOT_SUPPORTED_POS: BR/EDR not supported
SECOND_LENGTH_POS: second length
MANUF_DATA_TYPE_POS: manufacturer data type
MANUF_ID_BYTE_0_POS: manufacturer ID lower byte
MANUF_ID_BYTE_1_POS: manufacturer ID higher byte
MANUF_DATA_LENGTH_POS: data length
SERVICE_ID_BYTE_0_POS: service ID lower byte
SERVICE_ID_BYTE_1_POS: service ID higher byte
DATA_BYTE_0_POS: data byte 0
DATA_BYTE_1_POS: data byte 1
DATA_BYTE_2_POS: data byte 2 
DATA_BYTE_3_POS: data byte 3 
DATA_BYTE_4_POS: data byte 4 
DATA_BYTE_5_POS: data byte 5 
DATA_BYTE_6_POS: data byte 6 
DATA_BYTE_7_POS: data byte 7 
CALIB_RSSI_POS: calibrated RSSI 

with the defined values:

0x02: first length 
ADV_FLAGS_TYPE: adv flags type 
BR_EDR_NOT_SUPPORTED: BR/EDR not supported 
(uint8_t)(MANUF_DATA_LENGTH + 4): second length 
MANUF_DATA_TYPE: manufacturer data type 
(uint8_t)MANUFACTURER_ID: manufacturer ID lower byte 
(uint8_t)(MANUFACTURER_ID >> 8): manufacturer ID higher byte 
MANUF_DATA_LENGTH: manufacturer data length 
(uint8_t)MANUF_SERVICE_ID: service ID lower byte 
(uint8_t)(MANUF_SERVICE_ID >> 8): service ID higher byte 
0x00: Data 0 
0x00: Data 1 
0x00: Data 2 
0x00: Data 3 
0x00: Data 4 
0x00: Data 5 
0x00: Data 6 
0x00: Data 7 
TX_POWER_MEASURED_RSSI: RSSI TX power

The MANUFACTURER_ID is attributed at each company from Bluetooth SIG and in this case it is flash memory defined.
The SERVICE_ID is also flash memory defined and it is a custom field indicating a specific service implemented by the device. 
This field is used by other compatible products to understand the behaviour of the device.
The following 8 bytes are specific to the service ID and represent the shared data between devices that support that service.
The CALIB_RSSI field is a calibrated value of RSSI in two's complement. It is not used by a scanner device at the moment (TO BE DEFINED). 

1.1.2 - Advertised service data
Advertised data from a remote controller are 8 byte long.
The defined service ID is the only supported and related data bytes are managed as below:

DATA_BYTE_0_POS: Current state
DATA_BYTE_1_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_2_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_3_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_4_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_5_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_6_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_7_POS: not used 

The new light values are updated when the controller confirms to be stable in a position prior movement detection (TO BE IMPLEMENTED SINCE IT UPDATES THE CURRENT POSITION AFTER A FEW SECONDS AT EVERY NEW DETECTED MOTION STATE).

The data 0 field is updated with a different value for every motion state as followings:
"X UP"    : 0x10				
"X DOWN"  : 0x11
"X ROT R" : 0x12	
"X ROT L" : 0x13
"Y UP"    : 0x14			
"Y DOWN"  : 0x15	
"Y ROT R" : 0x16	
"Y ROT L" : 0x17	
"Z UP"    : 0x18					
"Z DOWN"  : 0x19	
"Z ROT R" : 0x1A	
"Z ROT L" : 0x1B


1.2 - Services
1.2.1 - CFG Service
BASE UUID: 0x8A, 0xAF, 0xA6, 0xC2, 0x3A, 0x32, 0x8F, 0x84, 0x75, 0x4F, 0xF3, 0x02, 0x01, 0x50, 0x65, 0x20 
This custom service allows a remote configuration of the device and special operations through the following characteristics:

1) UUID: 0x02 - BYTE 1 which is a 1 byte long characteristic. Generic configuration value not used at the moment;
2) UUID: 0x04 - BYTE 2 which is a 1 byte long characteristic. Generic configuration value not used at the moment;;
3) UUID: 0x06 - SHORT 1 which is a 2 bytes long characteristic. Generic configuration value not used at the moment;;
4) UUID: 0x08 - SHORT 2 which is a 2 bytes long characteristic. Generic configuration value not used at the moment;;
5) UUID: 0x0A - SPECIAL OP which is a 1 byte long characteristic for special operations. There is only one operation at the moment:
	value 0xA9 for rebooting the device in bootloader mode;

1.2.2 - Battery Service
The standard Battery Service as specified by Bluetooth SIG.

1.2.3 - Device Information Service
The standard Device Information Service as specified by Bluetooth SIG.
